        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by allowing them to access and process external information sources during generation. This ensures the model's responses are grounded in factual data and avoids hallucinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "A common problem with LLMs is that they don't understand private knowledge, that\n",
        "is, your organization's data. With RAG Engine, you can enrich the\n",
        "LLM context with additional private information, because the model can reduce\n",
        "hallucinations and answer questions more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining additional knowledge sources with the existing knowledge that LLMs\n",
        "have, a better context is provided. The improved context along with the query\n",
        "enhances the quality of the LLM's response.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following concepts are key to understanding Vertex AI RAG Engine. These concepts are listed in the order of the\n",
        "retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data ingestion**: Intake data from different data sources. For example,\n",
        "  local files, Google Cloud Storage, and Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data transformation**: Conversion of the data in preparation for indexing. For example, data is split into chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Embedding**: Numerical representations of words or pieces of text. These numbers capture the\n",
        "   semantic meaning and context of the text. Similar or related words or text\n",
        "   tend to have similar embeddings, which means they are closer together in the\n",
        "   high-dimensional vector space.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data indexing**: RAG Engine creates an index called a corpus.\n",
        "   The index structures the knowledge base so it's optimized for searching. For\n",
        "   example, the index is like a detailed table of contents for a massive\n",
        "   reference book.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question or provides a prompt, the retrieval\n",
        "  component in RAG Engine searches through its knowledge\n",
        "  base to find information that is relevant to the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Generation**: The retrieved information becomes the context added to the\n",
        "  original user query as a guide for the generative AI model to generate\n",
        "  factually grounded and relevant responses.\n",
